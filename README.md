This project is the backend of an Airline Management System written in Java and employs a variety of abilities like Object-Oriented Programming, Logic, Arrays, Streams, Collectors, and others.
It features various classes with diverse functions, such as arranging different seat capacities and establishing new flights for the corporation, as well as ways to search and book flights for users.
This project provides user interaction by using the Scanner function in Java, which allows the user to interact with the system.
Furthermore, the project allows the system to work in an organized manner by adding flights to array lists that can be readily maintained.
It considers numerous realistic characteristics, such as searching for flights based on different parameters, as well as other factors like payment and booking.
It takes a more extensive approach in other areas to analyze changes in seat availability in real time after booking.
These characteristics enable the Airline Management System to be realistic and demonstrate actual developer talents.
